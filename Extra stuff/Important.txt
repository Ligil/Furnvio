Note:
db.js is for logging in 
(DO NOT MODIFY THIS as we all have the same username and password as practical)
Change it only when necessary

DBconfig is for server, not really much to change

DBConnection is where the real stuff happens, change things here
the setUpDB function is run in app.js BRANDNAMEDB, True forces new table creation, dropping previous and replacing them (line 18 DBConnection)
Specify in DBConnection.js relationship between tables

helpers/messenger.js and views/partials/_flashmsg.handlebars 
- is a version that uses one use cookies and icons, use this more often as u cant store error and erros while redirecting

- 'success_msg' for green
- 'error_msg' for red
- array of objects e.g [{text:'Error message'}, {}] for multiple red

for redirects
- check helpers/messenger.js for input, routes/main.js about for example
